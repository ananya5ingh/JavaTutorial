/*
 * Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
 * In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. 
 * Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’
 * Declare the variables of a class as private.
 * Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
 */

 // Basically you hide away implementation details within your class
//  and just provide a public API programming interface.

/*
 * Two classes are 'tightly coupled' if they're calling 
 * each other stuff all the time. --> horrible tangle
 * 
 * API - Application Programming Interface
