/*
-----Casting Numerical Values-----
Refer to source code of the course. Didn't make notes for this

-----Upcasting and Downcasting-----
The type of the variable determines what method you can call
and
The type of the object that the variable refers to determines which actual implementations will 
be used when you call that method.

Upcasting is safe - guaranteed by polymorphism

Downcasting is unsafe - need to be sure that the variable you're downcasting to really does
refer to an object of the tyoe you're downcasting to
